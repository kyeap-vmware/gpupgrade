The target cluster is now running. You may now run queries against the target 
database and perform any other validation desired prior to finalizing your upgrade.

WARNING: If any queries modify the target database prior to gpupgrade finalize, 
it will be inconsistent with the source database.`) + `

If you are satisfied with the state of the cluster, run "gpupgrade finalize --verbose" 
to proceed with the upgrade.

To return the cluster to its original state, run "gpupgrade revert --verbose".`

The target cluster has been upgraded to Greenplum %s

The source cluster is not running. If copy mode was used you may start 
the source cluster, but not at the same time as the target cluster. 
To do so configure different ports to avoid conflicts. 

You may delete the source cluster to recover space from all hosts. 
All source cluster data directories end in "%s".
MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY=%s

The gpupgrade logs can be found on the master and segment hosts in
%s

NEXT ACTIONS
------------
To use the upgraded cluster:
1. Update any scripts to source %s
2. If applicable, update the greenplum-db symlink to point to the target 
   install location: %s -> %s
3. In a new shell:
   source %s
   export MASTER_DATA_DIRECTORY=%s
   export PGPORT=%d
   
   And connect to the database

If you have not already, execute the “%s” data migration scripts with
"gpupgrade apply --gphome %s --port %d --input-dir %s --phase %s"

If you postponed creating optimizer statistics run
"vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages"
for each database`

var RevertCompletedText = `
The source cluster is now running version %s.

If you have not already, execute the “%s” data migration scripts with

To restart the upgrade, run "gpupgrade initialize --verbose" again.`
