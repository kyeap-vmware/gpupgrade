-- Since we test data migration scripts both 1) after upgrading and 2) reverting
-- after initialize and execute we reuse the same expected file to avoid code
-- duplication. We have one file for 5X named _5.out and another for 6X named
-- _6.out. A base file name.out is needed to prevent pg_isolation_regress from
-- failing with missing expected output. The isolation2 framework first compares
-- the base expected file name.out, and then any subsequent files such as _5.out,
-- and _6.out. If any of them match the test passes.
